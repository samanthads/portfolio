			<h1>Battleship for iOS</h1>
			<div class="col-md-12">
				As a senior Computer Science major, I took a course whose main purpose was to teach us how to build iOS apps. One app that I made was an iPhone app for the common game Battleship. It has both a one player version in which you can play against an AI that I made, and a two player version. Each player places their five ships on the board and then takes turns shooting at each others' ships by clicking on one of the 100 possible squares. The players are informed of hits by sounds and score changes. Once one player has sunk all of the other player's ships, the game ends and a winner is declared!

				Below are some screenshots of the game.
